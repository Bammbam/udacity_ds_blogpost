## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Boston Airbnb data from 2016 to better understand:

1. What kind of accommodation do they have in Boston?
2. Which are generally get occupied?
3. Which factors make them so hot for bostonians?


The full set of files related to this project are posted on this link here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a jupyter notebook file which contains code used to answer these questions 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@rachatachankanasuk/airbnb-boston-dataset-analysis-e8e0640474c5).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
